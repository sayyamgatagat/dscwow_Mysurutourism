The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as puragiri (literally, citadel), and is now known as the Old Fort. Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was demolished and constructed multiple times. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace was burnt ablaze. Mysore Palace is now one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than 6 million annual visitors.",

The bonsai garden was established in 1986 in Mysore by Swamiji as a part of the ashram. He saw bonsai as a mystic enterprise – “a rare human endeavor that has held me in awe and introspecting over years. In the miniature plant lives a grand life. It reflects the cosmic creation, the play of celestial paradoxes near, yet far, more, yet less, known, yet unknown, Small yet Big”. Though it started out as a small project, the garden quickly grew over the next decades, becoming a major attraction at the ashram. At present, it is spread over 4 acres.",
