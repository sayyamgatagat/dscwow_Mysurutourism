        <h1>Mysuru Palace</h1>
        <p class="placepara">The Mysore Palace is a historical palace and the royal residence at Mysore in the
            Indian State of Karnataka. It is the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the
            Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore
            is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one; however,
            'Mysore Palace' refers specifically to this one within the Old fort.

            The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as puragiri (literally, citadel), and is
            now known as the Old Fort. Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century,
            which was demolished and constructed multiple times. The current structure was constructed between 1897
            and 1912, after the Old Palace was burnt ablaze.

            Mysore Palace is now one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more
            than 6 million annual visitors.</p>
